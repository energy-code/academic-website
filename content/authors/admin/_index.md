I am currently the Director for Nuclear Energy Innovation at the Breakthrough Institute with a focus on research and policy related to the role of nuclear energy in reducing impacts on the environment and health. 
I completed a doctorate in Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University where I researched decision-making under deep uncertainty and emergency response to nuclear power accidents. I also hold an MBA and degrees in mechanical and nuclear engineering. I have 20 years of R&D innovation experience with interdisciplinary problems. 
Outside of engineering and research, I am on the editorial board for Case Studies in the Environment, a member of multiple standards working groups, an assistant band director for a local school district, and an emergency first responder.
