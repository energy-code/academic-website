title: Risk-informed Robust Off-site Protective Action Decision Making for
  Nuclear Power Plant Emergencies
abstract: >
  Off-site emergency planning is required for nuclear power plants. Current
  planning is completed using deterministic assumptions in domain-specific
  sections (e.g. transportation, communication) to meet site licensing
  regulations. Risk to the population is not considered in many of these
  sections as the primary measure of effectiveness. The combination of these
  studies does not result in overall situational awareness needed for robust
  decision making in the event of an emergency. We find that the typical
  deterministic assumptions in current plans result in overconfidence in the
  ability of a protective action to avoid dose. When comparing protective action
  strategies, a balance is needed between transportation risk and dose risk. As
  expected, the amount of early warning is a major factor in avoiding dose.
  However, early warning does not affect the portion of dose avoided uniformly
  across protective action strategies. It is only through a risk-based
  integrated decision model that a more complete understanding of robust
  protective action selection and decision making under uncertainty can be
  achieved. Minimizing evacuation time has been the standard practice but does
  not always minimize risk. Rapid decision making and communication is essential
  to increase early warning. The typical assumptions result in overpredicting
  the effectiveness of a protective action which may result in selection of a
  less than ideal strategy.
